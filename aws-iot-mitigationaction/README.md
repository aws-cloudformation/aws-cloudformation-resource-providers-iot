aws cloudformation deploy  \
--stack-name cfn-contract-test-dependencies-mitigation-action \
--template-file packaging_additional_published_artifacts/contract_test_dependencies.yml \
--capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM \
--region us-east-1
# Package the code with Maven
mvn package
# Start SAM which will execute lambdas in Docker
sam local start-lambda
# In a separate terminal, run the contract tests
cfn test --enforce-timeout 240
# Execute a single test
cfn test --enforce-timeout 240 -- -k <testname>
```
